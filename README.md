## 1. Introduction

The **Design System Library** is a collection of reusable, customizable UI components built with Angular and documented using Storybook. This library is designed to provide a consistent, accessible, and scalable foundation for building web applications.

## 2. Project Goals

- **Consistency**: Ensure a uniform look and feel across all UI components used in the application.
- **Reusability**: Create modular components that can be easily reused across different parts of an application.
- **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG standards to make components accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Scalability**: Design components that are flexible and scalable to meet the growing needs of any project.
- **Customization**: Allow for easy theming and customization to adapt the design system to various branding requirements.

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Angular**: The core framework used for building the UI components.
- **Storybook**: A tool for documenting, testing, and showcasing the components in isolation.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor used for writing organized, reusable, and maintainable styles.
- **Jasmine & Karma**: Testing frameworks used for unit testing the components.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience and code maintainability.

## 4. Component Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- **Component Names**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `ButtonComponent`).
- **File Names**: Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `button.component.ts`).
- **Selectors**: Use `app-` as the prefix for component selectors (e.g., `<app-button>`).

### Folder Structure

Organize components in a structured manner for better maintainability:

src/
└── app/
├── components/
│ ├── button/
│ │ ├── button.component.ts
│ │ ├── button.component.html
│ │ ├── button.component.scss
│ │ └── button.stories.ts
│ ├── form/
│ ├── modal/
│ └── card/
└── shared/
└── services/

### Component Architecture

Each component should be:

- **Self-Contained**: Encapsulate all HTML, CSS, and logic within the component.
- **Configurable**: Provide input properties to customize the component’s behavior and appearance.
- **Documented**: Document each component’s usage, API, and variations in Storybook.

## 5. Design Principles

### Accessibility

- **ARIA Attributes**: Incorporate ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure components are fully navigable via keyboard.
- **Color Contrast**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines for color contrast to ensure readability.

### Responsiveness

- **Mobile-First Design**: Design components to be responsive, starting with mobile devices and scaling up.
- **Media Queries**: Use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.

### Theming

- **CSS Variables**: Use CSS variables for theming, allowing easy customization of colors, fonts, and other design elements.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Provide built-in support for light and dark themes.

## 6. Storybook Documentation

- **Component Stories**: Document each component in Storybook with interactive examples.
- **Knobs/Add-ons**: Use Storybook knobs and add-ons to allow real-time manipulation of component properties.
- **Usage Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions on how to use each component, including code snippets.

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each component using Jasmine and Karma to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- **Accessibility Tests**: Use automated tools like Axe to test and validate the accessibility of components.
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Consider implementing visual regression testing to catch unintended visual changes.

## 8. How to Contribute

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository on GitHub.
- **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
- **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your work is complete, submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes.
- **Code Reviews**: All contributions will undergo code review to ensure they meet project standards.

## 9. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- **Angular CLI**: Install the Angular CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```
